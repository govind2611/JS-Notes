The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":
*/
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
 


/*
JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute:
*/

//  In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
//  Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
//  and also can be added a external js file
