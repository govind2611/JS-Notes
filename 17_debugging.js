/*
Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.
Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.
With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.
Normally (otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page), you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.

// Setting Breakpoints
/*
    In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.
    At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.
    After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).
*/

// The debugger Keyword
/* 
    The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.
    This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.
    If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.
*/


/* 
    Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs.
    The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect) stuck in the electronics.
